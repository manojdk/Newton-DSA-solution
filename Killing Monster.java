Find the maximum number of monsters the friends can kill.

**Input**
The first line of input contains an integer N.
The next line contains N+1 integers Ai.
The next line contains N integers Bi.

**Constraints**
1 <= N <= 100000
1 <= Ai, Bi <= 1000000000

**Output**
Output a single integer, the maximum number of monsters that can be killed.
