**Problem Statement**
Sara has developed a new algorithm to find sprime :
For an integer n , To find all the sprime between 1 and n , she will start from the end n , mark it as sprime, and then mark all its factors (excluding itself) as not sprime. Then she will find the next greatest unmarked number less than the current sprime number , mark it as sprime, and mark all its factors (excluding itself) as not sprime. She will continue this process till all the numbers between 1 and n has been marked either sprime or not sprime .
Your task is to calculate the the number of sprimes that are also prime between 1 and n.

**Input**
The first line contains T the number of test cases.
Each of the next T lines contain an integer n.

**Constraint:-**
1 <= T <= 100
2 <= n <= 10000000

**Output**
Output T lines, one for each test case, containing the required answer.

**Example**
Sample Input :
3
2
4
7
Sample Output :
1
1
2
Explanation:-
For test 3:- 7 and 5 are the required primes */
